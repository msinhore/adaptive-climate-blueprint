### Breaking Changes - v2.0
- Blueprint filename remains the same for compatibility
- All existing automations continue to work without changes
- New features are opt-in through boolean selectors
- Enhanced logging provides more detailed information

### Examples - Smart Features in Action
- **Hot Day Scenario**: Outdoor 35°C, Raw target 25.3°C → Rounds DOWN to 25°C (saves cooling energy)
- **Cold Day Scenario**: Outdoor 5°C, Raw target 20.7°C → Rounds UP to 21°C (saves heating energy)
- **Window Opening**: Indoor drops 2.5°C in 3 minutes → HVAC paused for 15 minutes (prevents energy waste)
- **Seasonal Winter**: Indoor 24°C > Target 22°C → FAN mode instead of COOL (100% cooling energy saved)
- **Seasonal Summer**: Indoor 20°C < Target 22°C → FAN mode instead of HEAT (100% heating energy saved)
- **Dual Climate - TRV Priority**: Outdoor 0°C, Indoor 18°C, Target 21°C → TRV heats to 21°C, AC supports at 20°C (35% heating efficiency gain)
- **Dual Climate - AC Priority**: Outdoor 12°C, Indoor 19°C, Target 21°C → AC heats to 21°C, TRV supports at 21.5°C (rapid response + background warmth)
- **Dual Climate - Secondary Heating**: Indoor 17°C, Target 21°C (4°C difference) → Both systems activate for maximum heating capacity
