# Refactor Log - Adaptive Climate Blueprint

## Major Refactoring - Window Detection Logic and Control Flow

### Date
Current refactoring session

### Problems Addressed

1. **Helper Update Issue**: The previous temperature helper was being updated on every automation run, not just when actual window/door detection occurred. This caused false state references and unreliable detection.

2. **Control Logic Bypass**: All ASHRAE 55, comfort, occupancy, and ventilation rules were being bypassed when window/door detection was active. The system had three separate branches:
   - Window/door detected → Turn off HVAC
   - Natural ventilation → Turn off HVAC  
   - Normal control → Apply all rules
   
   This meant critical comfort and energy rules were ignored during detection periods.

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Fixed Helper Update Logic
- **Before**: Helper updated at the end of every automation run
- **After**: Helper updated only when:
  - Window/door detection is triggered (in detection branch)
  - No detection occurs (in normal flow)
- **Benefit**: More accurate state tracking, prevents false positives/negatives

#### 2. Restructured Control Flow
- **Before**: Three separate, mutually exclusive branches
- **After**: Two main branches:
  1. Window/door detected → Turn off HVAC + Update helper + EXIT
  2. Normal control → Apply ALL ASHRAE 55, comfort, occupancy rules (regardless of natural ventilation availability)

- **Natural Ventilation**: Now handled WITHIN normal control logic as part of comfort zone management, not as separate blocking condition

#### 3. Enhanced Logic Flow
```
IF window_door_open_detected:
  - Turn off HVAC
  - Update helper with current temperature
  - Log detection event
  - EXIT

ELSE (no window/door detection):
  - Apply full ASHRAE 55 adaptive comfort logic
  - Handle heating/cooling/comfort zones
  - Apply seasonal optimizations  
  - Handle natural ventilation opportunities
  - Apply occupancy rules
  - Update helper with current temperature
  - Log normal operation
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Reliable Detection**: Helper state is now properly maintained
2. **Complete Rule Coverage**: All comfort/energy rules always apply when no window/door detection
3. **Better Integration**: Natural ventilation is part of comfort logic, not blocking condition
4. **Improved Debugging**: Clear log messages distinguish detection vs normal updates

### Files Modified
- `blueprints/ashrae55_adaptive_comfort.yaml` - Complete action section refactor
- `REFACTOR_LOG.md` - This documentation

### Testing Needed
- Verify helper updates correctly during normal operation
- Verify helper updates correctly during detection events  
- Verify all ASHRAE 55 rules continue to function
- Test natural ventilation integration
- Test detection accuracy with new helper logic
