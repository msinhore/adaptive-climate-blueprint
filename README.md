**Intelligent climate control implementing adaptive comfort model. Automatically adjusts your AC/heating based on outdoor weather conditions for optimal comfort and energy savings.**

## 🎯 What This Does (Simple Version)

**Problem**: You manually adjust your thermostat when it gets hot/cold outside, wasting energy and time.

**Solution**: This blueprint automatically changes your AC/heating temperature based on the weather outside using scientifically proven comfort models.

### Real Example:
- **Hot day (35°C outside)**: Sets AC to 27°C (comfortable, energy efficient)
- **Mild day (20°C outside)**: Sets AC to 23°C (you need less cooling)
- **Cool day (10°C outside)**: Sets heating to 20°C (cozy without waste)

### Bottom Line:
**Set it once, save 15-30% on energy bills, stay comfortable year-round with Adaptive Comfort adaptive comfort standards.**

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmsinhore%2Fadaptive-climate-blueprint%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fashrae55_adaptive_comfort_v2.yaml)

3. **Create Automation**
   - Go to Settings → Automations → Blueprints
   - Find "Adaptive Comfort Adaptive Climate Control" blueprint
   - Fill in your AC device and temperature sensors
   - Choose your comfort category (I, II, or III)
   - Done!

4. **Start Saving Money! 💰**

## ⚙️ Simple Configuration

### Basic Setup (Most People)
```yaml
# Just 3 things needed:
climate_entity: climate.your_ac_or_heating          # Your AC/heating device
indoor_temp_sensor: sensor.room_temperature         # Any room temperature sensor  
outdoor_temp_sensor: weather.home                   # Built-in weather (free)
```

### v2 Sensor Options:
- **Temperature sensors**: Physical sensors, weather services (OpenWeatherMap, Open-Meteo, etc.), or input_number entities
- **Weather integration**: Use any Home Assistant weather service as outdoor temperature source
- **Manual input**: Create input_number entities for manual temperature/humidity override
- **Flexible setup**: Mix and match sensor types as needed

### HVAC Mode Configuration:
**Important**: This blueprint only adjusts temperature setpoints - it does not automatically switch between heating/cooling modes.

**Recommended Setup**:
- **Best practice**: Set your AC to "Auto" mode for seasonal operation
- **Manual control**: You can manually select Heat, Cool, or Dry modes directly on your AC as desired
- **Seasonal changes**: Expected to manually adjust mode when transitioning between seasons
- **Manufacturer offsets**: Some ACs (like Daikin) apply internal offsets in heat mode - see FAQ for workarounds

### What It Does Automatically:
- **🌡️ Calculates optimal temperature** based on Adaptive Comfort adaptive comfort model
- **⚡ Saves energy** when you're away (if you have motion sensors)
- **🌬️ Uses free cooling** when outside air is perfect
- **🔄 Adjusts all day** as weather changes
- **💧 Considers humidity** for better comfort (optional)

### Advanced Options (Optional):
- **Motion sensors**: Extra energy savings when away
- **Humidity sensors**: Better comfort in humid weather  
- **Multiple rooms**: Set up one per room/AC unit
- **Comfort categories**: Choose precision level (I, II, or III)
- **Weather services**: OpenWeatherMap, Open-Meteo, AccuWeather, Met.no
- **Manual overrides**: Use input_number entities for testing/calibration

## 🧠 How It Works (The Smart Part)

Instead of keeping your AC at a fixed temperature (like 22°C all year), this blueprint:

1. **Checks the weather outside** every few minutes
2. **Calculates the perfect indoor temperature** using Adaptive Comfort adaptive comfort standards
3. **Automatically adjusts your thermostat** to that temperature
4. **Saves energy** because the "perfect" temperature changes with outdoor conditions

### Example Magic:
- **Winter (5°C outside)**: Perfect indoor = 20°C (cozy, not overheated)
- **Spring (15°C outside)**: Perfect indoor = 22°C (comfortable)  
- **Summer (35°C outside)**: Perfect indoor = 27°C (cool enough, not freezing)

**Why This Saves Money**: Traditional thermostats use the same temperature year-round, fighting against nature. This works WITH the weather using scientifically proven comfort models.

## 🎯 Perfect For You If:

- You use **SmartIR or any HA-compatible AC/heating**
- You want to **save money without thinking about it**
- You're tired of **manually adjusting the thermostat**
- You like **"set it and forget it" automation**
- You want **Adaptive Comfort adaptive comfort standards** (not just guessing)

## ❓ Common Questions

### "What exactly does this do that my thermostat doesn't?"
Your thermostat keeps the same temperature year-round. This blueprint changes the target temperature based on outdoor weather using Adaptive Comfort adaptive comfort standards, which is more comfortable and uses 15-30% less energy.

### "Do I need special hardware?"
No! Works with whatever AC/heating you already have in Home Assistant (SmartIR, climate entities, etc.) plus any indoor temperature sensor. You can even use weather services instead of outdoor sensors.

### "Is this just for opening windows?"
No, that's a small part. The main function is **automatically adjusting your AC/heating setpoint** based on weather conditions using scientifically proven comfort models. The window/door detection feature automatically pauses HVAC when rapid temperature changes are detected (both increases and decreases), preventing energy waste when ventilating.

### "How much energy does it really save?"
In real testing: 15-30% savings. Your results depend on your local climate, home insulation, and current thermostat habits.

### "What if I don't like the temperature it picks?"
You can set minimum/maximum temperature limits and choose comfort categories (I, II, or III). It will never go outside your comfort range.

### "Does it work with SmartIR?"
Yes! That's actually one of the main target platforms. Works with any Home Assistant climate entity.

### "Can I use it without outdoor sensors?"
Yes! v2 supports weather services (OpenWeatherMap, Open-Meteo, etc.) so you don't need physical outdoor sensors.

### "My AC beeps every time - can this be fixed?"
Yes! v2 includes smart state management that only sends commands when settings actually need to change. No more unnecessary beeps in bedrooms!

### "My Daikin AC has a +2°C offset in heat mode - how do I handle this?"
Some manufacturers (like Daikin) apply internal offsets. Create a template sensor to compensate: if heat mode, subtract 2°C from the ASHRAE target before sending to your AC. This keeps ASHRAE calculations accurate while working with manufacturer quirks.

### "Does the blueprint automatically switch between heating and cooling?"
No - it only adjusts temperature setpoints. You should manually set your AC to "Auto" mode for seasonal operation, or manually select Heat/Cool/Dry modes as desired. This gives you control while the blueprint handles optimal temperatures.
